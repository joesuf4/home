# Home directory git repo

I use this primarily to distribute my home directory's essential
files across several servers at the ASF.  The sources are found
on my local workstation, is pushed to my github account, and from
there is cloned to my home directory across various ASF hosts.  At
the ASF we have a few scripts for sysadmins to use to run shell commands
across several machines, and this setup allows me to update each host by
simply by running git pull.

Most of my worktime is spent in zsh running inside a screen session on
my workstation, and that's reflected in my config.  Obviously I use emacs
a lot, and the .emacs-lisp dir contains a few essential elisp extensions;
I couldn't get by without some of them.

The configs are messy and not really aimed at public distribution, but
I'd be happy to consider appropriate patches if there's something you'd
like to see me make use of.
